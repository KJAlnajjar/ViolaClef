# ViolaClef

ViolaClef is a swift project I've made to practice TDD and the things I've learned from a book I've read recently and really liked called `iOS Unit Testing by Example XCTest Tips and Techniques Using Swift by Jon Reid`.

I've paid way more attention to the code and the tests than the UI of the application, the way we code is as important as the UI.

## The idea behind the project

I've made this application to help anyone with the sight-reading part of the Alto clef for Viola learners like myself!

## Technologies

- As I mentioned earlier this is a swift project which has been built using the TDD method!
I got to learn how powerful tests could be when used/written correctly and how more clean they could make your project when written before the production code!

- The project has no storyboard or XIB files, fully programmatically.

- The architecture of the project is MVVM-C.
